Troubleshooting
------------------------------
* **Visualizations Not Populating**: Verify that "Cherwell Add-on For Splunk" has been installed and configured. You can also verify if the data is being collected or not by using **\`cherwell_index\` sourcetype="cherwell:bo:\*"** query.

Known Limitations
------------------------------
* Sometimes you might observe widgets are being displayed in "All Time" duration and not being displayed or showing inaccurate data in a particular time duration ex: "Last 2 hours" though the data is present. This is because of the Daylight time issue in "Splunk Add-on For Cherwell". Because of this issue in add-on some events may get indexed in future date time when daylight saving is on due to which Splunk fails to capture those events though being present. However these events are captured when "All Time" duration is selected.
